             <h1> hypertext</h1>
            <p>  HTML is an abbreviation for Hypertext Markup Language.
              Summarizing in one sentence: HTML is a language for publishing content (text, image,
              video, audio, etc.) on the Web.</p>
             <p> HTML is based on the concept of Hypertext. Hypertext are sets of elements – or nodes
              – linked by links. These elements can be words, images, videos, audios, documents
              etc.</p>
              <p>These elements together form a large information network.</p> <br>
              <p>They are not linked linearly as if they were texts in a book, where one subject is linked to the other over and over again.</p>
             <p> The connection made in a hypertext is something unforeseen that allows the communication of data,
              organizing knowledge and storing related information.</p> <br>
             <P>To distribute information globally, there needs to be a language that is
              universally translated by various means of access. HTML presents itself as this language.</p>
            <p>  Developed by Tim Berners-Lee when HTML gained popularity
              Mosaic - browser developed by Marc Andreessen in 1990 - has gained traction. <br> From
              hence, browser developers and makers using HTML as a base, sharing how
              same conventions  </p>
