             <h1>What is HTML5?</h1>
             <p> HTML5 is the new version of HTML4.
             While the WHATWG defines the dialing rules that</p>
             <p> we will use in HTML5 and XHTML, they also define APIs that will form the basis of the architecture
              web. These APIs are known as DOM Level 0.    </p> 
              
              <h1>Continus</h1>
            <p> One of the main goals of HTML5 is to facilitate the manipulation of the element, allowing the
developer to modify the characteristics of objects in a non-intrusive way and in a way that
be transparent to the end user.</p>
<p>Unlike previous versions, HTML5 provides tools for CSS and Javascript to do their job in the best possible way. <br> HTML5 allows, through its APIs, the manipulation of the characteristics of these elements, so that the website or application remains light
and functional.</p>
<p>HTML5 also creates new tags and modifies the function of others. Old versions of HTML
did not contain a universal standard for creating common and specific sections such as footer,
header, sidebar, menus and etc. <br> There was no standard for naming IDs, Classes or tags.
There was no method of automatically capturing the information located in the footers
of the websites.</p>
<p>There are other elements and attributes whose function and meaning have been modified and which can now be reused more effectively. For example, elements like B or I that were deprecated in earlier versions of HTML now take on different functions and deliver more
meaning for users.</p>
<p>HTML5 changes the way we write code and organize information on the page.
It would be more semantics with less code. <br> It would be more interactivity without the need for installation
of plugins and loss of performance. <br> It is the creation of interoperable code, ready for future devices and that facilitates the reuse of information in different ways.</p>
<p>WHATWG has been focused on maintaining backward compatibility. <br> No website should have to
be completely redone to adapt to the new concepts and rules. <br> HTML5 is being created
so that it is compatible with recent browsers, making it possible to use the new features immediately.</p>
